## Installations

:point_right: To see the deployed application [Click here to go to the deployed application section](#deployed-application)

:computer: To run this locally, please make sure you [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

- After you have installed Node.js. Clone the repository to your local machine. In the terminal, run ```npm install``` to install all the required dependencies and run ```npm run start``` to start the app. Then, visit http://localhost:3001/ :heavy_check_mark:

## Usage
Visiting the deployed application link will take you to my Home/About page, where you'll find my name, a navigation bar, a short description about myself (currently a placeholder, to be updated in the future), and links to my GitHub repository and LinkedIn in the footer section. The page's topics can be accessed through the navigation bar at the top right, and depending on the page you're on, the corresponding tab will be highlighted.

On the portfolio page, you'll discover some of my past projects. Clicking on the links will direct you to my GitHub repository and the demo/deployed app. If you'd like to discuss more about my work, feel free to send me a message using the form on the 'Contact Me' page (please note that it currently doesn't send the messageâ€”this is a planned future implementation).

Lastly, on the 'Resume' page, you can download a PDF file to learn more about my past experiences.
